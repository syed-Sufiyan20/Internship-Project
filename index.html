            <p>Hi there! I'm Syed Sufiyan, an aspiring web developer with a passion for creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications.
            This portfolio is my digital home where I share my journey into the world of web development, highlight the projects I've worked on, and document the skills I’m continuously building in front-end and back-end technologies. 
            From HTML and CSS to JavaScript, React, and beyond, I'm excited to show what I’ve learned and how I apply it to real-world challenges.
            Whether you're a fellow developer, potential collaborator, or just curious about what I do, I'm glad you're here. This site is still evolving just like my skills but feel free to explore, and don’t hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to connect!
            Thanks for stopping by.
            </p>

            <div class="container">
            <div class="text">
            <p>I'm a junior web developer with a strong interest in building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites.
                My journey into web development began through self-study and hands-on practice, and I've since developed a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've also started working with modern tools and frameworks like React and Git to create dynamic and interactive web experiences. I'm always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges that help me become a better developer. Whether working on personal projects or collaborating with others, 
                I’m passionate about turning ideas into real, functional solutions on the web. <br>
                Some of the technologies that i know are
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Sql, Git, and GitHub.
                I am currently learning React to expand my skill set and build more complex applications.

                    <p>During my final year project,I had done rain forecast predictor with the help of rain sensor and andruino board. 
                        A Rain Sensor IoT system using Arduino is a simple yet effective project designed to detect rainfall and send alerts or control devices accordingly. 
                        It typically uses a rain sensor module that detects the presence and intensity of water droplets. The sensor is connected to an Arduino microcontroller, which reads the analog or digital signals and processes them.
                        When rain is detected, the Arduino can trigger actions like sending alerts via Wi-Fi (using ESP8266/NodeMCU), activating alarms, or controlling actuators like closing windows or retracting solar panels.
                        This project is widely used in smart irrigation, weather monitoring, and home automation systems.
                        It’s an excellent application of IoT for real-world environmental monitoring.

                    <p>This project was done as a internship assingment. A Responsive Landing Page is a key component of modern web development that adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices. Built using HTML, CSS, this project focuses on creating an engaging first impression for users with clear content layout, smooth navigation, and compelling visuals. 
                        The page typically includes sections like a hero banner, features, testimonials, and a call-to-action (CTA) button. Responsive techniques such as CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries ensure that the layout adjusts for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices seamlessly. 
                        This project is ideal for practicing UI/UX design, accessibility, and frontend performance optimization. 
                        It's a great foundation for building professional websites and portfolios.

                    <p>The Ola webpage interface project focuses on designing a modern, responsive web page inspired by the layout and functionality of the official Ola Cabs platform. The page features key sections such as service highlights (like ride-hailing, rentals, and outstation trips), promotional content, and a booking input UI. 
                        Developed using core web technologies (HTML5, CSS3), the layout employs CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure adaptive alignment and responsive scaling. 
                        Media queries are used to optimize the user experience across various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops. 
                        This project emphasizes clean UI structure, intuitive navigation, and visual consistency, offering practical experience in recreating real-world product designs and enhancing user interface development skills.
